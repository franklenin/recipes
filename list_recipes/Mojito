Mojito

Originating in Cuba, this refreshing rum-based sip is filled with mint and limeâ€”a perfectly tropical combination for sipping by the pool or beach. And if you're craving a little literary cred, the mojito was also said to be a favorite of famed author Ernest Hemingway.



- 2 oz white rum
- .75 oz lime juice
- .5 oz simple syrup

Muddle mint into a shaker tin, then add ice and all other ingredients. Shake to chill and strain into a highball glass with ice. Top with club soda if desired and garnish with mint.
