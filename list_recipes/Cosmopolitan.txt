The cosmo became almost ubiquitous in the '90s thanks to the TV show Sex and the City, but this spin on the martini remains just as tasty today as when Carrie Bradshaw made it famous.

- 1.5 oz citrus vodka
- 1 oz Cointreau 
- .5 oz lime juice
- .25 oz cranberry juice

Build all ingredients in a shaker tine with ice and shake. Strain into a martini glass and garnish with lime wheel or zest.
